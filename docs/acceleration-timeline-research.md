## Key Narrative Points for the Deck

1. **One company. One month. Trillions in value shifted.** Not a market crash from a recession or a war. From *product announcements.*

2. **Each release targeted a different sector.** Legal. Finance. Security. Legacy IT. Enterprise workflows. Day after day, a different pillar of the economy got a tremor.

3. **A blog post crashed IBM 13%.** Not a product. Not a demo. A *blog post* about what Claude Code *could* do to COBOL. The market is reacting to *potential* now, not just reality.

4. **The cumulative math:** ~$2 trillion in software/services market cap lost from peak. In under a month. From one company's releases.
