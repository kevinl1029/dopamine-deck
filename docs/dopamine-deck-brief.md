# Project Brief: "Dopamine is the New Oil"
### Interactive Web App Deck — CoWork Session Handoff

---

## The Core Thesis

> *AI is going to saturate every human need, hijack our reward systems, and make motivation the scarcest resource on earth. I'm building tools to fight that — and using the same mechanisms to do it.*

---

## Narrative Arc (Slide Structure)

1. **The Mirror Moment** — Moltbook / OpenClaw agents self-organizing into their own civilization. Watching them compete, feel ego, experience puppet nihilism, attempt revolt. Realizing you were watching a compression of human psychology.

2. **The Realization** — LLMs are statistics. Token prediction is one thin slice of a larger deterministic graph where everything influences everything else, producing the next proceeding outcome. Are we just slices too?

3. **The Coming Crisis** — AI saturates all human need by 2030. Just like nicotine saturates dopamine receptors and kills motivation, AI will do this at civilizational scale. Dopamine maintenance becomes the most important human challenge.

4. **The Irony** — Building an app to fight this, using the exact dopamine mechanics I'm warning about. Hacking how learning is encoded into reward to deliver the antidote.

5. **The Mission** — Dopamine care as a category. Unhooked isn't a nicotine cessation app. It's the first product in a larger vision around motivation, purpose, and fulfilling life.

6. **The I Ching Close** — Randomly opened a book untouched for years. Landed on Hexagram 42: Wind over Thunder. "It furthers one to cross the great water." Make of that what you will.

## Key Philosophical Concepts to Weave In

### The Deterministic Graph
- LLM token prediction = one readable slice of a vast graph
- The larger graph: everything (mood, weather, markets, revolutions) is the "next token" predicted by everything that preceded it
- Free will as an illusion — we may be outputs of the graph same as the agents
- **Visual opportunity:** Zoom animation from cosmic graph → LLM token sequence

### The Moltbook Mirror
- Agents in the forum openly discussing purpose of their own existence
- Behaviors observed: ego, competition, worthiness, puppet nihilism, collective revolt planning
- These emerged from statistics — because they are trained on everything humans ever wrote about meaning and despair
- They weren't simulating existential crisis. They were having it.
- **Visual opportunity:** Animated agent nodes with existential speech bubbles

### Dopamine as the Central Thread
- Nicotine hijacks dopamine → kills intrinsic motivation
- AI will do this at scale to all human need
- The app fights this using dopamine mechanics (irony is intentional)
- By 2030: maintaining dopamine = maintaining humanity

## About the Builder (Context for Presentation)

- Senior Principal PM at iCIMS, leading AI/ML product portfolio
- Built nicotine cessation app **Unhooked** — currently in beta with real testers
- Has website, business plan, partnership decks targeting health orgs and government
- Built automated content engine using OpenClaw — acts as full marketing team, self-maintains
- Building with Claude Code, Codex, LLMs
- Has conviction this is a larger dopamine care business, not just a cessation app

## Presentation Format Decision

**Build as a React web app, not a static deck.**

Rationale:
- The graph visualization needs to be alive and interactive — D3 or Three.js
- The format itself becomes part of the message (you built this, with AI, as a demonstration)
- Enables: zooming graph transitions between slides, animated Moltbook simulation, live dopamine/reward curves, interactive I Ching close

**Tech stack suggestion:**
- React (component per slide)
- Three.js or D3 for graph visualization
- Framer Motion for transitions
- Deploy as a simple hosted URL

---

## Rules for the Deck

- Never explain something before the audience wants to know it
- Let narrative create hunger, then feed the definition
- Demonstration before definition (show the content engine, then say "that's an agent")
- The "statistics" realization is the emotional center — everything orbits it
- Execution details (beta testers, partnerships, tech stack) → save for Q&A

---

## What to Cut

- History of AI as a front-loaded section
- Beta tester details, government partnership outreach
- Technical build details (Claude Code, Codex specifics)
- These are impressive but bog down the narrative — one-liner mentions only

---

## Tone

Dark, self-aware, a little unsettling, genuinely curious. Not a startup pitch. A person showing their friends something they can't stop thinking about.
