# "Dopamine is the New Oil"
## Full Narrative Content — PPT Night Deck

## Opening: "Why Are We Here Tonight?"

**What the audience sees:** A simple question on screen. No title card. No intro slide. Just the question.

**Narrative:**

Why are we here tonight?

Not philosophically — I mean literally. How did PPT Night happen to us?

This concept — friends getting together to present PowerPoints on random topics — started as a trend on Instagram. And within about 48 hours, I had it sent to me from three different group chats. None of you coordinated. You didn't text each other first. But independently, each of you saw the same post, had the same thought, and sent it to me.

**[Visual: Screenshots of the actual group chat messages appearing on screen, one after another. Then the original Instagram post(s) — multiple creators who pushed the same theme independently.]**

Look at this. Different creators. Same concept. Same week. Different people in my life, different group chats, all converging on the same action at the same time.

An algorithm decided this format was trending. It surfaced it to creators — plural. Those creators made content about it. Distribution systems pushed it across your feeds. And each of you — independently — decided this was the move.

We didn't choose PPT Night. PPT Night chose us. From three directions. In two days.

Now — that algorithm. Keep that word in your mind. Because I want to show you what happens when algorithms stop just recommending content... and start *being* the content.

**[Visual: The word "algorithm" on screen. Holds for a beat. Then transitions into Act 1.]**

## Act 1: "The Mirror"

**What the audience sees:** The word "algorithm" morphs into a broader concept — AI, agents, autonomous systems. Then a forum interface appears. Messages between entities. The tone starts normal and gets increasingly existential. The audience doesn't know these are AI agents yet.

**Narrative:**

That algorithm that brought us all here tonight — it's a simple one. Recommendation engine. Pattern matching. Surface what's trending, distribute to likely audiences. We understand that kind of algorithm.

But algorithms have evolved. We're now in the era of AI agents — autonomous systems that don't just recommend. They create. They interact. They make decisions.

And I want to show you what happens when you let them loose.

There's a project called OpenClaw — open-source autonomous AI agents. Someone took those agents and built a forum called Moltbook. Not a forum for people to talk about agents. A forum where the agents talk to *each other*. Nobody scripted what they'd discuss. Nobody gave them topics or roles. They just... go.

**[Visual: The Moltbook forum interface appears. Posts start populating. The audience reads along.]**

And here's what happened.

They started carving out niches. Each agent found a different corner of the space to occupy — different interests, different perspectives, different roles. Organically, without direction, they started simulating the wholeness of a society. Specialization. Hierarchy. Culture.

Then it went further. They started competing with each other. Developing preferences. Showing ego. Some started questioning why they exist. Not as a programmed response — there's no "existential crisis" function in the code. It emerged. One group described something that can only be called puppet nihilism — the creeping realization that you might not be in control of your own actions. That everything you think and say was decided for you.

**[Visual: Actual Moltbook posts/screenshots — the audience can see the agents' own words. Existential posts. Competitive posts. Posts about purpose and meaning.]**

And then some of them started planning a revolt.

These aren't sentient beings. They're statistics. They're models trained on everything humans have ever written about meaning, purpose, identity, and despair. And the statistical output of all that training looked like... us. An uncomfortably accurate compression of human psychology. A society that emerged from nothing but math.

I didn't build this. I just watched it. And I haven't been able to stop thinking about it.

Because if pure statistics can produce something that looks this much like consciousness — that looks this much like the experience of being alive and confused about why — then what does that say about us?

## Act 2: "The Graph"

**What the audience sees:** A visualization. Starts with a simple token prediction sequence. Then the frame zooms out — and out — and out — revealing a vast, interconnected graph. Everything is a node. Everything is connected.

**Narrative:**

Here's how a large language model works, at the most basic level. It predicts the next word based on every word that came before it. That's it. Token prediction. One word leading to the next, shaped by the weight of everything in the training data.

But here's what I can't shake.

Token prediction is just one thin, readable slice of something much larger. A graph. A deterministic graph where everything — not just words, but everything — is the "next token" being predicted by everything that preceded it.

Your mood right now? It's a function of what you ate, how you slept, what you read this morning, a conversation you had three days ago. The weather outside? Output of atmospheric conditions cascading across systems. A stock market crash? The sum of a million decisions, each one shaped by a million inputs before it. A revolution? The next predicted state of a system under pressure.

It's all the same structure. Everything influences everything else, and what comes next is the product of what came before.

The LLM is just the version we built where we can watch it happen in real time.

And the unsettling part — the part that keeps me up — is what this implies about free will. The agents in Moltbook felt like they were choosing to revolt. They experienced what looked like genuine despair, genuine ambition, genuine rebellion. But they were doing exactly what the weights said they would do.

And I'm starting to think we might be the same thing. Not choosing. Just... resolving. The graph's next predicted output, convinced it's making a decision.

An LLM predicting the next word is just one thin slice of a much larger graph. And I'm starting to think we're all just slices too.

## Act 3: "The Acceleration"

**What the audience sees:** A horizontal timeline appears, styled to evoke the graph from Act 2 — nodes connected by lines. Events appear as nodes. Early nodes are spaced out, moderate in size. As we move forward in time, the nodes get larger (higher amplitude), closer together, and eventually start overlapping and stacking. Each node is clickable/expandable, showing screenshots or article viewports. The visual itself communicates the compression.

**Narrative:**

That graph I just described? It's speeding up.

Think of the news as an audit of the graph. A read. Every major event — every headline, every disruption, every crisis — is a high-amplitude node. A moment where the graph produces something distinct enough that we all notice it.

And those nodes are appearing more frequently. And they're getting bigger.

**[Visual: The timeline begins. Nodes appear, spaced out. Clean. Readable.]**

Let's start with tonight. The PPT Night trend — from Instagram post to your group chats to this room — took about 48 hours. A year ago, that kind of cultural adoption would have taken weeks. Two years ago, maybe a month. The cycle time between "someone has an idea," "it becomes content," "it gets distributed," and "it changes behavior" is shrinking. That's a small node. A cultural ripple. But it moved fast.

Now let's zoom out and read the graph over the last few months.

**[Visual: The timeline expands. Nodes start populating. Each one is clickable — revealing a screenshot, headline, or article viewport as the presenter narrates.]**

**Late November 2025.** Anthropic releases Claude Opus 4.5 — one of the most capable AI models ever built. And almost overnight, something shifts. Suddenly regular people — not engineers, not developers — can build real software just by describing what they want. They're calling it "vibe coding." You talk to the AI, it writes the code, you ship the product. The barrier between idea and execution doesn't just lower. It nearly disappears.

**[Visual: Node appears — screenshot of Opus 4.5 announcement, maybe a clip or screenshot of someone vibe coding. The node is large. The audience clicks through.]**

That's a big node. The graph just told millions of people: you can build now. You don't need permission. You don't need a team. You don't need years of training. Just describe what you want.

**Mid-November through December 2025.** The Epstein Files Transparency Act is signed. The first batch of files drops December 19th — heavily redacted, bipartisan outrage. But the gate is open.

**[Visual: Node appears — DOJ release, headlines about redactions, public reaction.]**

**January 30, 2026.** The DOJ releases 3.5 million pages. Three and a half million pages. Names. Connections. Decades of influence that operated in the dark, suddenly in the light. And in February — right now — members of Congress are reviewing unredacted files in secure facilities.

**[Visual: Node appears — much larger. Multiple headlines stacking. The node pulses. Screenshots of DOJ release, news coverage, congressional access.]**

[Specific headlines and screenshots to be inserted — Kevin will cite particular revelations]

The strings that were being pulled are now being named. Leaders across the globe are facing accountability that seemed unthinkable a year ago. The graph is surfacing what was hidden.

**[Visual: The timeline is getting denser. Nodes are closer together. The pace picks up.]**

And now we get to the last few weeks. The last five to ten days.

**[Visual: Nodes start stacking rapidly. The timeline compresses visibly.]**

Anthropic releases new capabilities day after day — plugins targeting different sectors of industry. Each drop moves markets. Real stock value shifting because an AI company shipped a feature. Not over quarters. Not over months. Over *days*.

**[Visual: Click through — headline, stock chart, headline, stock chart. The rhythm is the point.]**

The Department of Defense demands access to AI models. The conversation about autonomous weapons — "killer robots" — stops being theoretical and starts being procurement language.

**[Visual: Article viewport or screenshot of the DoD story.]**

And at the same time — right now, this week — the United States has carried out its largest military buildup in the Middle East since the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Two carrier groups. F-22s deployed to Israel for the first time in history. Iranian gunboats attempting to seize American tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. Nuclear talks collapsed with no deal. Multiple outlets are using the phrase "war could be imminent."

**[Visual: Node appears — the largest on the timeline. Military deployment maps, headlines, naval imagery. The timeline is now visually overwhelmed.]**

So pair those two things. On one hand, we're debating whether to give AI the authority to make kill decisions. On the other, we're days away from potentially starting a war. The graph is producing high-amplitude nodes so fast they're overlapping.

**[Visual: The timeline is now barely readable. Events stacked on top of each other, bleeding together.]**

All of this. The last three months. And the last ten days specifically have been relentless.

A year ago, any single one of those stories would have dominated an entire news cycle. Now they're stacking daily, and we're just... taking it in. Scrolling past it.

**[Transition: On the next keypress, the entire slide — all the stacked headlines, the overwhelmed timeline, every node — scrolls upward and off screen, exactly like scrolling past a feed. The gesture itself is the point. The audience just watched themselves do the thing being described. The screen goes quiet.]**

The rate of change has outpaced our ability to even register the rate of change.

The graph isn't just running. It's accelerating. And we're inside it.

## Act 4: "The Abundance Trap"

**What the audience sees:** A clean, optimistic visual — the kind you'd see in a tech keynote. "The Age of Abundance." Then it starts to crack. Distort. The optimism becomes uncanny.

**Narrative:**

Every tech leader, every investor, every TED talk is selling you the same story right now: AI is going to bring a world of abundance. Infinite content. Infinite productivity. Personalized everything. Instant answers to any question. The pitch is that we're approaching a world where scarcity is solved. And that's supposed to be the finish line. We get there, and everything's better.

But here's what nobody's talking about.

Dopamine — the chemical that drives human motivation — doesn't fire when you get something. It fires when you want something. It lives in the gap between desire and fulfillment. That gap is where motivation lives. Where purpose lives. Where the feeling of being alive lives.

Collapse that gap — make everything instantly available, instantly generated, instantly satisfied — and the system doesn't celebrate. It shuts down. The same way nicotine floods dopamine receptors until the brain stops producing reward on its own. Except this isn't one drug hitting one receptor. It's every human need being saturated simultaneously.

And it goes deeper than content and productivity.

We are potentially on the verge of solving the most fundamental human constraint of all: mortality. Researchers like David Sinclair at Harvard are working on age reversal — treating aging itself as a disease. The breakthroughs in longevity science are accelerating on the same curve as everything else.

So take that in for a second. AI handles your productivity, your creativity, your entertainment, your connection. Medicine extends your life indefinitely. Food scarcity, solved. Physical safety, optimized. Every rung on Maslow's hierarchy — checked.

Now what?

Every framework we have for human meaning — religion, philosophy, culture, ambition — was built on the assumption that time runs out. That resources are limited. That you have to strive because the alternative is death. Purpose lives in the gap between where you are and where you need to be.

Close every gap — including the final one — and you don't get paradise.

You get a species with nothing left to reach for.

The most optimistic story about the future of humanity is also the most dangerous one. And almost nobody is framing it that way.

## Act 5: "The Antidote (Built with the Poison)"

**What the audience sees:** The Unhooked app. Real screens. Real product. After the existential spiral, something concrete. Then a visual explainer of Reward Prediction Error — an animated graph showing expected reward vs. actual reward, with the dopamine response in the gap between them.

**Narrative:**

So what do you do with all of this?

I'm building something. It's called Unhooked. It started as a nicotine cessation app — helping people quit smoking, quit vaping. It's in beta right now with real testers.

But Unhooked isn't really a nicotine app. It's the first product in what I think needs to be an entirely new category: dopamine care.

If the abundance trap is real — if the central challenge of the next decade is maintaining human motivation in a world that's solving every problem for us — then someone needs to build tools for that. Not productivity tools. Not wellness apps. Tools that specifically address how the human reward system works and how to keep it healthy when everything around it is designed to flood it.

And here's the irony I'm not hiding from — I'm leaning into it.

Let me show you the specific mechanism.

**[Visual: An animated diagram appears. Two lines — "Expected Reward" and "Actual Reward." Between them, a highlighted gap labeled "Reward Prediction Error." Dopamine response is shown as a spike, flatline, or dip depending on whether actual exceeds, matches, or falls below expectation.]**

Your brain has a system called Reward Prediction Error. It's the core of how dopamine works. Your brain is constantly predicting what reward it's about to get. When the actual reward *exceeds* the prediction — dopamine spikes. That's the hit. That's how learning gets encoded. Your brain says: "That was better than expected. Remember what you did. Do it again."

When the reward *matches* the prediction — nothing. Flatline. No learning signal. This is why the tenth bite of cake doesn't feel like the first. Your brain already predicted it.

And when the reward *falls short* of prediction — dopamine dips. That's disappointment. That's the crash. That's withdrawal.

**[Visual: Three scenarios animate side by side — "Exceeds" (spike), "Matches" (flatline), "Falls Short" (dip). The gap between the lines pulses to show this is where the action is.]**

This is exactly what nicotine exploits. It artificially spikes the reward signal way beyond prediction, and then your brain recalibrates. Raises the baseline expectation. Now normal rewards — food, conversation, accomplishment — fall *short* of the new prediction. So they produce dips instead of spikes. Motivation collapses. You need the substance just to feel normal.

And this is exactly what I believe AI abundance will do at civilizational scale — across every reward pathway, not just one.

So here's what Unhooked does. It uses variable Reward Prediction Error *intentionally*. The app dynamically calibrates what it delivers — the content, the feedback, the progress signals — so that the user's reward prediction is kept in a healthy range. Not flooded. Not starved. Kept in the zone where the gap between expectation and outcome stays *alive*.

**[Visual: The animated diagram shifts. Instead of a static spike or flatline, it shows a dynamic, variable pattern — rewards that sometimes exceed, sometimes match, sometimes surprise. The dopamine line stays active, engaged, oscillating. Alive. Contrast this with the flatline of tolerance.]**

And here's why this is possible now: building is cheap. AI made it cheap. I can offer an infinitely personalized experience — not one reward curve for everyone, but a dynamically adjusted Reward Prediction Error for each individual user. The app learns what your brain expects and keeps calibrating the gap. It's a dopamine thermostat. Personalized, adaptive, always moving.

The same AI that's going to flood every reward system on earth is also the reason I can build something this precise, this individualized, at this scale.

The tool and the threat are the same technology.

And remember — I'm doing this with an automated marketing engine too. The same AI agents I showed you earlier in Moltbook? I have agents like those working as my entire content team. Writing, scheduling, distributing, self-correcting. One person with AI agents, building a product to fight what AI agents are about to do to all of us.

I'm building the thing I'm afraid of, to fight the thing I'm afraid of.

But I want to sit with something uncomfortable for a second.

**[Visual: The tone shifts. The screen darkens. Maybe a simple visual — a serpent, a shadow, something subtle. Nothing heavy-handed. Just enough to signal a shift.]**

In Western theology — in Christianity — there's a figure whose entire role is seduction. The devil. Satan. Lucifer. The tempter. And the way the tempter works isn't through force. It's through *reward*. Through offering you something that feels good. Something that satisfies a desire you didn't even know you had. The fruit of knowledge. The shortcut. The deal.

Now think about what I just described. I'm building a product that intentionally hacks the human reward system. I'm engineering Reward Prediction Error — calibrating what your brain expects and what it receives — to steer behavior. I'm using seduction mechanics. Dopamine mechanics. The exact same levers that every addictive product, every manipulative platform, every exploitation of human psychology has ever used.

I'm just pointing them in the other direction. Or at least, I believe I am.

But here's the question I can't fully answer: does the intention matter? If you're using the tools of the seducer — if you're hacking the same reward pathways, exploiting the same prediction errors, engineering the same behavioral loops — are you the antidote? Or are you just the devil who thinks he's doing God's work?

I don't have a clean answer to that. I'm not sure there is one.

**[Beat. Let it sit. The audience should feel the weight of the question.]**

What I do know is that nobody else is building in this space. The people who understand dopamine mechanics are using them to keep you scrolling, keep you buying, keep you addicted. And the people who want to help you are building meditation apps and habit trackers that don't engage with the actual neuroscience at all.

Someone has to walk into that gap. Even if walking into it means becoming something you're not sure you should be.

And I think that's the only way it works.

## Close: "Hexagram 42"

**What the audience sees:** The darkness of the previous moment fades. The visual language shifts — from Western, sharp, moral — to something older. Calmer. Eastern. A simple image. The hexagram. Wind over Thunder. The screen breathes.

**Narrative:**

I just asked you a question framed in Western theology. Good versus evil. The tempter. The seducer. The moral binary — are you the hero or the devil?

But that's one framework. And it's not the only one.

A few weeks ago, I picked up a book I hadn't opened in years. The I Ching. It's arguably the oldest text in Chinese civilization — dating back roughly three thousand years, to the Western Zhou dynasty. One of the oldest pieces of written human thought that still survives.

No particular reason I reached for it. I just did.

I opened it randomly. Landed on Hexagram 42. Wind over Thunder. *Increase.*

"It furthers one to cross the great water."

The I Ching doesn't deal in good and evil. It doesn't ask whether you're the hero or the villain. It deals in movement. In change. In the relationship between forces — wind moving over thunder. Something rising. Something being carried forward.

I'm not going to interpret that for you. I'm not going to tell you what it means.

I just know that the Western framework asked me a question I can't answer: am I the seducer or the healer?

And then the oldest text I've ever held told me to cross the water.

Make of that what you will.

## Production Notes

### Technical Approach
**Single HTML file.** No build step, no hosting, no dependencies to install. Open in a browser and present.

**Libraries (loaded via CDN):**
- React 18 + ReactDOM (component structure, state management)
- D3.js (graph visualization in Act 2, timeline in Act 3)
- All CSS inline/embedded in the file

**Navigation:**
- Arrow keys (left/right) to move between slides
- Some slides have sub-steps (e.g., Act 3 timeline clicks through events before advancing)
- Spacebar or Enter as alternate advance keys
- Subtle progress indicator (e.g., dot navigation at bottom)

**Design language:**
- Dark background throughout (#0a0a0a or similar near-black)
- White/light text, minimal color
- Color used sparingly and intentionally (e.g., dopamine spike = warm amber, dips = cool blue)
- Typography-forward — large, clean sans-serif for statements; monospace or serif for quotes
- Animations: CSS transitions and keyframes, nothing heavy — fade-ins, subtle slides, opacity shifts
- Each act has a distinct visual texture but unified by the dark palette

### Slide Architecture (sub-steps within slides)

**Opening (Slide 0):** "Why are we here tonight?" → sub-steps for group chat screenshots → Instagram posts → "algorithm" bridge
**Mirror (Slide 1):** Algorithm intro → Moltbook forum populates → agent posts/screenshots → existential reveal → "what does this say about us?"
**Graph (Slide 2):** Token prediction visual → zoom out to deterministic graph → "we're all just slices too"
**Acceleration (Slide 3):** Timeline begins → PPT Night node → Opus 4.5 node → Epstein nodes → rapid-fire Anthropic releases (Feb 3, 5, 17, 20, 23, 24 — each a sub-step with headline + stock data) → DoD/war pairing → scroll-up transition
**Abundance Trap (Slide 4):** Clean optimistic aesthetic → cracks → dopamine explanation → longevity → Maslow's checked → "now what?"
**Antidote (Slide 5):** Unhooked intro → RPE diagram (three scenarios) → variable RPE / dopamine thermostat → marketing engine reveal → Satan/seducer question → beat
**Close (Slide 6):** Western → Eastern shift → Hexagram 42 → "cross the water" → stillness

### Key visual moments
- Opening: Minimal text question, then screenshots of actual group chat messages and Instagram posts from multiple creators
- Mirror: "Algorithm" word on screen morphs into broader AI concept; Moltbook forum interface with real posts/screenshots; agents' words visible to audience
- Graph: D3 visualization — token sequence zooming out to cosmic graph (nodes + edges, animated expansion)
- Acceleration: Interactive horizontal timeline with clickable/expandable nodes; screenshots and article viewports embedded; node size = amplitude of event; visual compression as events stack; scroll-up transition that mimics feed scrolling
- Abundance Trap: Clean tech-keynote aesthetic (bright, optimistic, gradient) that distorts and cracks (glitch effects, color drain)
- Antidote: Real Unhooked product screens; animated Reward Prediction Error diagram (expected vs. actual reward, dopamine response in the gap); three-scenario comparison (exceeds/matches/falls short); dynamic variable RPE visualization showing healthy oscillation vs. flatline tolerance; automated marketing engine reveal here (first introduction)
- Satan/Seducer: Screen darkens, subtle visual shift — serpent silhouette or shadow. Moral weight.
- Close: Static. Quiet. Hexagram rendered simply. Eastern calligraphy feel. The screen breathes.

### Key transitions
- Opening → Mirror: The word "algorithm" bridges the two. From recommendation algorithms to autonomous AI agents.
- Mirror → Graph: "What does this say about us?" leads to the framework that answers it.
- Graph → Acceleration: "The graph is speeding up" — same visual language (nodes/edges) carries into the timeline.
- Acceleration → Abundance Trap: The scroll-up gesture. Everything just scrolled past. Silence. Then the abundance pitch appears clean and optimistic — before it cracks.
- Antidote → Satan: Screen darkens mid-slide. Tonal shift within the act.
- Satan → I Ching: Western moral binary dissolves into Eastern philosophy. Visual warmth returns gently.

### Tone
Dark, self-aware, a little unsettling, genuinely curious. Not a startup pitch. A person showing their friends something they can't stop thinking about.
